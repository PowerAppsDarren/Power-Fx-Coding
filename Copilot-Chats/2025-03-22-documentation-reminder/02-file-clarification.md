# File Clarification

## Prompt
I ONLY SEE 1 FILE!! ???

## Response
I apologize for the confusion. You're right - in my previous response, I only created one documentation file:

1. `01-readme-reference.md` - Which acknowledged your reminder about following the documentation structure

Let me clarify what just happened:
1. You shared the README.md file with me
2. I created the documentation file for that exchange
3. Now you've sent me three files: the main README.md, the Developers-Start-Here README.md, and my documentation file

This current exchange is now being documented in this second file (`02-file-clarification.md`), following the sequential numbering requirement.

If you have a specific task you'd like me to help with regarding this repository, please let me know, and I'll continue documenting our conversation properly with each exchange in its own numbered file.
