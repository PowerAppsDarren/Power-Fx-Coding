# README Reference Reminder

## Prompt
Please reference the README.md documentation requirements for our conversation structure.
#file:README.md ⬅️ Remember: Each exchange needs its own numbered markdown file in the appropriate dated folder under Copilot-Chats. #codebase  #file:README.md  

## Response
I've acknowledged your reminder about following the README.md documentation requirements. For this and all future exchanges regarding this repository, I'll maintain the specified structure:

1. **Organizing by date and topic**:
   - Created folder: `2024-05-19-documentation-reminder`
   - This file is the first in our conversation: `01-readme-reference.md`

2. **Properly formatted content**:
   - Each file includes both the prompt and response
   - Structured with clear headings for readability

I'll continue to follow this pattern for every exchange in our conversation, creating sequential markdown files (02, 03, etc.) as we proceed.

If you have a specific task or question related to this API-Toolkit repository, please let me know, and I'll document our conversation accordingly.
