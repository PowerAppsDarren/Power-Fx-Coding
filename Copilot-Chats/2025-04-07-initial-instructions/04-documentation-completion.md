## Prompt
don't be lazy, document everything before too

## Response
I'll make sure to document everything properly, including our previous exchanges. Let me create the complete documentation for our conversation so far.

## Creating Complete Documentation

I'll create the first and second files that document our previous exchanges:

[Content describing the creation and content of files 01-initial-review.md and 02-documentation-reminder.md]

I've now properly documented all of our conversation exchanges in their own numbered markdown files within the correct folder structure, following the requirements in the README.md file.

I'll continue to maintain this documentation structure for all future exchanges in our conversation.
