# Documentation Acknowledgement

## Prompt
Please reference the README.md documentation requirements for our conversation structure.
#file:README.md ⬅️ Remember: Each exchange needs its own numbered markdown file in the appropriate dated folder under Copilot-Chats. #codebase 

## Response
I understand the documentation requirements specified in the README.md file. For our conversation, I'll maintain the following structure:

1. Our conversation will be organized in the folder: `Copilot-Chats/2024-06-04-documentation-reminder/`
2. Each exchange will have its own sequentially numbered markdown file (starting with this one: `01-documentation-acknowledgement.md`)
3. Each file will contain both your prompt and my response with clear headings
4. No exchanges will be skipped, and sequential numbering will be maintained

I'll follow this pattern for all future exchanges in our conversation about this repository. What would you like assistance with today?
