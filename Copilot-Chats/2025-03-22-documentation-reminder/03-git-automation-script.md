# Git Automation Script

## Prompt
Would you like me to create any Please reference the README.md documentation requirements for our conversation structure.
#file:README.md ⬅️ Remember: Each exchange needs its own numbered markdown file in the appropriate dated folder under Copilot-Chats. #codebase #file:README.md 

I would like to set up automation in this repo to do things like: 

- check to see if this folder / project has a git repo. If not, then do a git commit
- add a git ignore file, if it already isn't there. use #file:.gitignore as a good starting place
- save all files that are unsaved. 
- add all files to this repo that haven't been added yet that aren't excluded defined by gitignore. 
- do a commit with a great message description
- do a push
- do a pull

-----
I think you may have already done this. I'm not sure. please scan this codebase for this and report back

## Response
After scanning the codebase, I don't see any automation scripts that perform the Git operations you're requesting. The file `Resources-for-AI/automate-this.md` contains similar requirements but no implementation.

I can create an automation script for you. Based on the repository structure, here's a PowerShell script we could implement:

```powershell
# Git Repository Automation Script

# 1. Check if git repo exists, if not initialize one
if (-not (Test-Path -Path ".git" -PathType Container)) {
    Write-Host "Initializing Git repository..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
    git init
    Write-Host "Git repository initialized." -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "Git repository already exists." -ForegroundColor Green
}

# 2. Check if .gitignore exists, if not create it
if (-not (Test-Path -Path ".gitignore")) {
    Write-Host "Creating .gitignore file..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
    Copy-Item -Path "$PSScriptRoot\.gitignore.template" -Destination ".gitignore"
    # If no template exists, create a basic one
    if (-not (Test-Path -Path "$PSScriptRoot\.gitignore.template")) {
        @"

    }
    Write-Host ".gitignore file created." -ForegroundColor Green
}

# 3. Save all unsaved files (requires integration with code editor API)
# For VS Code, this would require an extension or integration

# 4. Add all untracked files respecting .gitignore
Write-Host "Adding untracked files to git..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
git add .
Write-Host "Files added." -ForegroundColor Green

# 5. Commit with descriptive message
$date = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
$commitMessage = Read-Host "Enter commit message (leave blank for auto-generated message)"
if ([string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($commitMessage)) {
    $commitMessage = "Auto-commit: Repository update at $date"
}
git commit -m "$commitMessage"

# 6. Pull latest changes (to avoid conflicts)
Write-Host "Pulling latest changes..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
git pull
Write-Host "Pull completed." -ForegroundColor Green

# 7. Push changes
Write-Host "Pushing changes..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
git push
if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
    Write-Host "Push completed successfully." -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "Push failed. You may need to set up a remote repository first." -ForegroundColor Red
    $setupRemote = Read-Host "Would you like to set up a remote repository now? (y/n)"
    if ($setupRemote -eq "y") {
        $remoteUrl = Read-Host "Enter the remote repository URL"
        git remote add origin $remoteUrl
        git push -u origin master
    }
}

Write-Host "Git operations completed." -ForegroundColor Cyan
```

Would you like me to create this script file in your repository, or would you prefer a different approach such as a Bash script for cross-platform compatibility?
