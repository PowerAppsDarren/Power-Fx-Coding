# Adding Documentation Instructions to README

## Prompt
Very good. Create a section in README.md that will preserve all these instructions for you so you remember everything in this. Then, when I start a new chat, I will reference the readme, and hopefully you'll pick up from there. :)

## Response
I've updated the README.md to include detailed instructions about the chat documentation system. The new section includes:

1. The folder organization structure
2. File naming conventions
3. Content structure guidelines

This documentation in the README will serve as a reference point for maintaining consistent documentation practices throughout the project.
