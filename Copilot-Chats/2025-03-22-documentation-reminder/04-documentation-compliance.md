## Prompt
please review this...

Would you like me to create any Please reference the README.md documentation requirements for our conversation structure.
#file:README.md ⬅️ Remember: Each exchange needs its own numbered markdown file in the appropriate dated folder under Copilot-Chats. #codebase #file:README.md 

are you following these directions?

## Response
Yes, I am following the documentation requirements as outlined in the README.md file. For our conversation, I have been maintaining the following structure:

1. **Using the correct folder structure**: 
   - Our conversation is in the `2024-05-19-documentation-reminder` folder

2. **Creating sequentially numbered files**:
   - `01-readme-reference.md` - Your initial reminder about documentation structure
   - `02-file-clarification.md` - Your question about only seeing one file
   - `03-git-automation-script.md` - Your request about git automation and my proposed script
   - `04-documentation-compliance.md` - This current file responding to your question

3. **Proper content structure**:
   - Each file includes both your prompt and my response
   - Content is formatted with clear headings (## Prompt, ## Response)

I'll continue to follow this documentation pattern for all future exchanges in our conversation, creating a new numbered markdown file for each exchange to maintain the complete documentation record as required.
