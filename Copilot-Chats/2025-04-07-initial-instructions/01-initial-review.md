## Prompt
review this #codebase and follow the directions in the readmes where it instructs you to document our work together!

## Response
I'll follow the documentation requirements from the README.md to structure our conversation properly.

This is our first exchange, so I'll create the appropriate folder structure with today's date (April 7, 2025) and begin with file `01-initial-review.md`.

Each exchange will be documented in its own numbered markdown file in the `Copilot-Chats/2025-04-07-initial-instructions/` folder, with both prompts and responses clearly separated with headings.

Based on the repository structure, I can see that this is a Power-Fx-Coding project with various resources, templates, and utilities. The README.md establishes clear documentation requirements that I'll follow throughout our conversation.

What specific aspects of Power-Fx would you like to work on today? I see the canvas-powerapp-ideas.txt file has some interesting project concepts we could explore.
