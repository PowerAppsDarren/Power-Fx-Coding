# Emphasizing Documentation Importance

## Prompt
Also, can you really stress this in the readme file so you never miss this?

#codebase 

## Response
I've updated the README.md to strongly emphasize the critical importance of following the documentation structure without exception. The changes include:

1. Added a dedicated section titled "⚠️ IMPORTANT - DOCUMENTATION COMPLIANCE ⚠️"
2. Used bold text and capital letters to stress the importance
3. Listed specific requirements that must be followed:
   - EVERY conversation must be documented
   - EVERY exchange must have its own numbered file
   - NO exchanges should be skipped or merged
   - Sequential numbering must be maintained

This prominent warning should help ensure that the documentation system is followed rigorously for all future interactions.
