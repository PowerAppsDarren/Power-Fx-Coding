# Automation Script Location

## Prompt
where are all the files you created for the automation I asked for?

#codebase 

## Response
I apologize for the confusion. I didn't actually create a separate script file in your repository yet - I only provided the PowerShell script as a code block within our conversation file `03-git-automation-script.md`. At the end of that response, I asked if you wanted me to create the actual script file or if you preferred a different approach like a Bash script, but we didn't continue that part of the conversation.

Would you like me to create the automation script as a proper file in your repository now? I would recommend placing it in one of these locations:

1. `c:\GIT-REPOS\API-Toolkit\Scripts\git-automation.ps1` - For PowerShell script
2. `c:\GIT-REPOS\API-Toolkit\Scripts\git-automation.sh` - For Bash script (cross-platform)

I can create either version (or both) based on your preference. The script would include all the functionality you requested:
- Check if the folder has a git repository
- Add a .gitignore file if needed
- Handle unsaved files (with some limitations)
- Add untracked files
- Create commits with descriptive messages
- Handle pull and push operations
