# Automation Enhancements

## Prompt
Very good. what else would be good to put in these scripts?

## Response
Here are several valuable enhancements we could add to the Git automation scripts:

1. **Configuration File Support**:
   - Create a `.gitautomation` config file that lets users customize script behavior
   - Allow setting default commit message templates
   - Configure file size thresholds for large file warnings

2. **Branch Management**:
   - Add options to create/switch branches
   - Include branch cleanup (delete merged branches)
   - Support for branch naming conventions

3. **Git LFS Integration**:
   - Automatically detect large files and suggest using Git LFS
   - Configure Git LFS settings if not already set up

4. **Pre-commit Checks**:
   - Add linting or formatting checks 
   - Scan for sensitive data (API keys, credentials)
   - Enforce commit message conventions (e.g., conventional commits)

5. **Repository Maintenance**:
   - Git garbage collection (`git gc`)
   - Repository optimization
   - Stale branch cleanup

6. **Logging and Reporting**:
   - Create log files of all operations
   - Generate summary statistics 
   - Email/notification options for team environments

7. **Command-Line Parameters**:
   - Add proper command-line argument support
   - Allow running specific operations (e.g., just commit or just push)
   - Include a `--help` option with documentation

Would you like me to implement any of these specific enhancements to the existing scripts?
