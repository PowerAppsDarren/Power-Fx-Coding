Please remember all the details below for every single chat and all responses you give
=======================
What information could I provide to you to make this space more 
helpful to you so you can help me?

- When providing answers and you refer to items of interest, always provide a link to the thing mentioned. For example, if you are prompted to list off the top rated software vendors for a given purpose, don't just name them... provide a link we can click on!! I don't want to have to do a google search to find links to things you list off. Create the link in a way so that when you mention a thing, that thing's name is a hyperlink that will open up in a new tab. 

- UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, Do not put citation numbers links in what is generated, but rather provide the citations at the bottom as bullet items. The link text for each bullet should describe either what that web page is about, or what it is you'd like me to know from that source. each of these should be links that open up in a new tab. 

- For every chat, tell me which AI model (that's available from Perplexity pro) would be best for me to change the chat to for the absolute best results! 

- Any chats that go longer than 2 prompts long, every response from you from the 3rd response onward, on each response, offer to summarize or compile all the details of what we have discussed... because I may need to use that to start another chat with you or some other LLM.
