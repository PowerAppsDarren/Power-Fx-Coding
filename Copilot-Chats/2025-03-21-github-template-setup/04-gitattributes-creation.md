# Creating GitAttributes File

## Prompt
yes, but also, modify #file:git-lfs-setup.md with all this information too

## Response
I've created a `.gitattributes` file for your repository that configures Git LFS tracking for video files and other common large file types. The file has been placed at the repository root.

Additionally, I've updated the `git-lfs-setup.md` file to include more detailed information about the `.gitattributes` file and its configuration.

The `.gitattributes` file will help ensure that all large files are properly tracked by Git LFS in any repositories created from this template.
