# New Chat Reference Instructions

## Prompt
Ok, very good. if I open up a new chat, what is the best way to get you to look at the readme file as instructions?

## Response
For a new chat session, here are the most effective ways to ensure I follow the documentation structure:

1. **Best approach**: Start your message with a clear reference like:
   ```
   I'm working on the API-Toolkit repository. Please reference the README.md documentation requirements for our conversation structure.
   ```

2. **Most reliable method**: Share the README.md content directly in your first message, either by:
   - Copy-pasting the content
   - Using VS Code's attachment feature to share the file
   - Referencing it as `#codebase` if you've attached it

3. **Quick reminder**: Include a brief reminder like:
   ```
   Remember: Each exchange needs its own numbered markdown file in the appropriate dated folder under Copilot-Chats.
   ```

By explicitly mentioning the documentation requirements at the beginning of each new chat session, you'll help ensure I follow the structure correctly throughout our conversation.
