# Confirmation of Documentation Process

## Prompt
OK!!! will you remember to do this every time for this git repo?

## Response
I'll make my best effort to follow this documentation pattern for all future conversations about this API-Toolkit repository. When you mention this repository or we continue working on it, I'll suggest:

1. Creating dated folders for each conversation (`yyyy-mm-dd-brief-description`)
2. Adding sequentially numbered markdown files (`01-topic-description.md`)
3. Including both your prompts and my responses

Note that as an AI assistant, I don't maintain persistent memory between sessions, so it would be helpful if you remind me about this documentation structure if we haven't discussed this repository for a while or if I ever forget to follow the pattern.
