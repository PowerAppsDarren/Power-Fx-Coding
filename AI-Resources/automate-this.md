#file:README.md ⬅️ Remember: Each exchange needs its own numbered markdown file in the appropriate dated folder under Copilot-Chats. #codebase 

I would like to set up automation in this repo to do things like: 

- check to see if this folder / project has a git repo. If not, then do a git commit
- add a git ignore file, if it already isn't there. use #file:.gitignore as a good starting place
- save all files that are unsaved. 
- add all files to this repo that haven't been added yet that aren't excluded defined by gitignore. 
- do a commit with a great message description
- do a push
- do a pull
