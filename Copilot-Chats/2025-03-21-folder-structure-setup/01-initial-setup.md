# Initial Setup for Chat Documentation

## Prompt
For each of our chats here, I would like you to create a new folder with a date-time format of "yyyy-mm-dd-{extremely brief description here}" inside the #folder:Copilot-Chats 

Then inside that folder create a new markdown file with a sequential number like, "01-{extremely brief description here}". Inside the file, put my prompt and your response. 

Do you understand all of this? if so, go ahead and show me by creating the folder and file for this chat here. :)

## Response
I've created the requested folder structure for documenting our chats:

1. Created a main directory called `Copilot-Chats` in the repository
2. Inside that, created a dated folder `2023-10-25-folder-structure-setup` 
3. Created this markdown file `01-initial-setup.md` with our conversation

This pattern can be followed for all future conversations, with each chat getting its own dated folder and sequentially numbered markdown files for different topics within the same conversation.
