# Folder Rename Instructions

## Prompt
Are you able to rename the folder: 2024-06-04-documentation-reminder now?

## Response
I don't have the ability to directly rename folders on your file system. However, I can provide instructions for you to rename the folder while maintaining the documentation structure:

### Steps to rename the folder:

1. **Create a new folder** with your desired name following the pattern:
   - Format: `yyyy-mm-dd-brief-description`
   - Example: `2024-03-29-time-implementation` (if that's today's actual date)

2. **Move all existing markdown files** from the current folder to the new folder:
   - `01-documentation-acknowledgement.md`
   - `02-date-time-correction.md`
   - `03-current-time-solution.md`
   - `04-time-resource-confirmation.md`
   - `05-folder-rename-instructions.md` (this file)

3. **Update the folder references** in each file:
   - Open each markdown file 
   - Change the filepath comment at the top to reflect the new folder name
   - For example, change:
     ```
     // filepath: c:\GIT-REPOS\Git-Repo-Template\Copilot-Chats\2024-06-04-documentation-reminder\01-documentation-acknowledgement.md
     ```
     to:
     ```
     // filepath: c:\GIT-REPOS\Git-Repo-Template\Copilot-Chats\[NEW-FOLDER-NAME]\01-documentation-acknowledgement.md
     ```

4. **Delete the old folder** once you've confirmed all files are moved and updated.

Remember: According to the documentation guidelines, the folder should be named with the actual date of our conversation to maintain a chronological record of development discussions.
