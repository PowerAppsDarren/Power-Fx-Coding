go do

## Response
I understand I need to create proper documentation following the README.md requirements. Let me create the necessary files for our conversation.

## Creating Documentation Structure

Based on the README.md requirements, I'll now properly document our conversation:

1. I'll create a new folder: `Copilot-Chats/2025-04-07-initial-instructions/`
2. I'll create these sequential files:
   - `01-initial-review.md` - My initial review and response
   - `02-documentation-reminder.md` - Your reminder about documentation
   - `03-file-creation.md` - This current exchange

Each file will follow the required format with proper headings for prompts and responses.
