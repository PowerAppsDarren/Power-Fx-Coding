# VS Code Keyboard Shortcuts

## Prompt
what is the key combination to save all open files in vs code?

## Response
The keyboard shortcut to save all open files in Visual Studio Code is:

- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+K S` (press Ctrl+K first, release K, then press S)
- **macOS**: `⌘+Option+S` (Command+Option+S)

This is different from saving a single file (`Ctrl+S` or `⌘+S`), as it saves all modified files in your workspace at once.
