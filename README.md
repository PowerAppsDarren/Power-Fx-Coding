## 🤖 To Start Things Off Right...

When you open a new Copilot chat session, be sure to paste this message to ensure we follow the documentation structure correctly:

```
Please reference the README.md documentation requirements for our conversation structure.
#file:README.md ⬅️ Remember: Each exchange needs its own numbered markdown file in the appropriate dated folder under Copilot-Chats. #codebase 
```


## Documentation
This repository includes a `Copilot-Chats` folder containing documentation of all GitHub Copilot conversations related to this project.

### Chat Documentation Structure
For all GitHub Copilot conversations related to this project, we maintain the following documentation structure:

1. **Folder Organization**:
   - Main folder: `Copilot-Chats/`
   - Conversation folders: `yyyy-mm-dd-brief-description/` (e.g., `2023-10-25-folder-structure-setup/`)
   
2. **File Naming**:
   - Files within each conversation folder are numbered sequentially
   - Format: `##-brief-description.md` (e.g., `01-initial-setup.md`, `02-confirmation.md`)
   
3. **File Content**:
   - Each file contains both the prompt and the response
   - Structured with headings for clarity (## Prompt, ## Response)

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT - DOCUMENTATION COMPLIANCE ⚠️
**It is CRITICALLY IMPORTANT that this documentation structure is followed WITHOUT EXCEPTION for EVERY interaction related to this project.**

- EVERY conversation must be documented
- EVERY exchange must have its own numbered file
- NO exchanges should be skipped or merged
- Sequential numbering must be maintained

This strict documentation system is essential for maintaining a complete record of the development process, decisions made, and solutions provided throughout the project lifecycle.

When starting a new conversation about this project, reference this README to maintain consistent documentation.
