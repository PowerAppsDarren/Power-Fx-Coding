# Current Time Solution

## Prompt
how can I set things up here so you would know what is the current time/date from the internet ?

## Response
Since AI assistants like GitHub Copilot don't have direct internet access to check the current time/date, we need a solution that keeps this information up-to-date in your repository. Here's what I recommend:

1. Create a utility script that fetches the current time from an internet time API
2. Have this script update a file in your repository with the current time information
3. You can run this script manually or set it up to run automatically

Let me outline the implementation:

### Solution: Time Update Utility

I'll create:
1. A Python script to fetch current time from the internet
2. A markdown file where the time information will be stored
3. Instructions for running and automating this process

This way, whenever you use Copilot with this repository, I can reference the updated time file to know the current date and time.
