# Time Resource Confirmation

## Prompt
ok! so from on how you will know to use these resources to know the date/time, right?

## Response
Yes, that's correct! From now on, I'll know to use the resources we've set up to determine the current date and time. Here's how it will work:

1. When you run the `update_time.py` script (either manually or through the git hook), it will fetch the current time from the internet and update the `Resources-for-AI/current_time.md` file with accurate information.

2. In future conversations, you can reference this file by including:
   ```
   #file:Resources-for-AI/current_time.md
   ```
   in your message.

3. When I see this reference, I'll check the file to get the current date and time information rather than relying on assumptions or the folder naming convention.

This approach allows me to have accurate time information even though I don't have direct internet access. Just remember to update the time information before our conversations by running one of these scripts:
- On Windows: `Scripts\update_time.bat`
- On Linux/Mac: `Scripts\update_time.sh`

The pre-commit git hook option will also keep the time information up-to-date whenever you make commits to the repository.
